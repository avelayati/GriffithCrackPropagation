# GriffithCrackPropagation
Griffith crack problem
This script is used to find displacement and stress intensity factor in crack propagation scenarios. 
Griffith asumptions: isotropic and homohgeneous solids to solve for stresses around a fracture

Inputs: Fracture toughness, Young's modulus, Injeciton pressure, Fracture half length, Poisson ratio
Output: Fracture max width, Stress intensity factor, displacement caused by fracking pressure at any point along the fracture
